 PSEPSI - add an EPSI formatted preview bitmap to an EPS file		

 psepsi <epsfile >epsifile						

 Note:									
 This application requires						
 (1) that gs (the Ghostscript interpreter) exist, and			
 (2) that the input EPS file contain a BoundingBox and EndComments.	
 Ghostscript is used to build the preview bitmap, which is then		
 merged with the input EPS file to make the output EPSI file.
