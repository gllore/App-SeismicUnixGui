 bckgr=0.5              background gray value				

 NOTES:								
 The curve file is an ascii file with the points specified as x1 x2 	
 pairs, one pair to a line.  A "vector" of curve files and curve	
 colors may be specified as curvefile=file1,file2,etc.			
 and curvecolor=color1,color2,etc, and the number of pairs of values   
 in each file as npair=npair1,npair2,... .				

 You may eliminate the blocky appearance of psimages by adjusting the  
 d1s= and d2s= parameters, so that psimages appear similar to ximages.	

 All color specifications may also be made in X Window style Hex format
 example:   axescolor=#255
