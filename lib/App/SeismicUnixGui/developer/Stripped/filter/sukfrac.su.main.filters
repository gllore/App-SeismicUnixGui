 SUKFRAC - apply FRACtional powers of i|k| to data, with phase shift 

     sukfrac <infile >outfile [optional parameters]			

 Optional parameters:							
  power=0		exponent of (i*sqrt(k1^2 + k2^2))^power		
			=0 ===> phase shift only			
			>0 ===> differentiation				
			<0 ===> integration				
  sign=1		sign on transform exponent       		
  d1=1.0		x1 sampling interval				
  d2=1.0		x2 sampling interval				
  phasefac=0		phase shift by phase=phasefac*PI		
  ...directional derivative, active only if angle= is set ....		
  angle=		if set applies operator directionally in the	
			direction specified by the value of angle,	
			-360.0 <= angle < 359.99999 degress		

 Notes:								
 The relation: w = 2 pi F is well known for frequency, but there	
 doesn't seem to be a commonly used letter corresponding to F for the	
 spatial conjugate transform variables.  We use K1 and K2 for this.	
 More specifically we assume a phase:					
		-i(k1 x1 + k2 x2) = -2 pi i(K1 x1 + K2 x2).		
 and K1, K2 define our respective wavenumbers.				

 Algorithms 								
 	g(x1,x2)=Re[2DINVFFT{ ( (sign) i |k|)^power 2DFFT(f)}e^i(phase)]
 where: 								
       |k| = sqrt[ (k1)^2 + (k2)^2 ] 					
 or when angle= is set 						
       |k| = sqrt[ (k1  cos(angle) )^2 + (k2 sin(angle) )^2 ] 		

 In the default mode a factor of (i|k|)^(power) is applied in the 	
 transform domain. For time data the time axis direction is taken to 	
 be the k1-direction.  The effect of this filter is to differentiate   
 the input in the normal direction to any curvilinear features in	
 in the data, and thus be a non-directional-specific edge enhancer.	

 If angle= is set, then the intended effect is a derivative in the 	
 direction specified by the angle, with the k1-direction being angle=0,
 corresponding to curves whose normals lie in the x1-direction. 	

 Caveat:								
 Large amplitude errors will result of the data set has too few points.

 Examples:								
 Edge sharpening: 							
 Laplacean : 								
    sukfrac < image_data  power=2 phasefac=-1 | ... 			

 Image enhancement:							
   Derivative filter:							
    sukfrac < image_data  power=1 phasefac=-.5 | ... 			

 Image enhancement:							
   Half derivative (this one is the best for photographs): 		
    sukfrac < image_data  power=.5 phasefac=-.25 | ...
