 SUWAVEFORM - generate a seismic wavelet				

 suwaveform <stdin >stdout [optional parameters]			

 Required parameters:						  	
	one of the optional parameters listed below			

 Optional parameters:						  	
	type=akb	wavelet type					
		   akb:	AKB wavelet defined by max frequency fpeak	
		   berlage: Berlage wavelet				
		   gauss:   Gaussian wavelet defined by frequency fpeak	
		   gaussd:  Gaussian first derivative wavelet		
		   ricker1: Ricker wavelet defined by frequency fpeak	
		   ricker2: Ricker wavelet defined by half and period	
		   spike:   spike wavelet, shifted by time tspike	
		   unit:	unit wavelet, i.e. amplitude = 1 = const.

	dt=0.004	time sampling interval in seconds		
	ns=		if set, number of samples in  output trace	

	fpeak=20.0	peak frequency of a Berlage, Ricker, or Gaussian,
		   and maximum frequency of an AKB wavelet in Hz	

	half=1/fpeak   Ricker wavelet "ricker2": half-length		
	period=c*half  Ricker wavelet "ricker2": period (c=sqrt(6)/pi)
	distort=0.0	Ricker wavelet "ricker2": distortion factor	
	decay=4*fpeak  Berlage wavelet: exponential decay factor in 1/sec
	tn=2	   Berlage wavelet: time exponent			
	ipa=-90	Berlage wavelet: initial phase angle in degrees		
	tspike=0.0	Spike wavelet: time at spike in seconds		
	verbose=0	1: echo output wavelet length			


 Notes:								
	If ns is not defined, the program determines the trace length	
	depending on the dominant signal period.			   

	The Ricker wavelet "ricker1" and the Gaussian wavelet "gauss
	are zero-phase. For these two wavelets, the trace header word	
	delrt is set such that the peak amplitude is at t=0 seconds.	
	If this is not acceptable, use "sushw key=delrt a=0".		

	The Ricker wavelets can be defined either by the peak frequency	
	fpeak ("ricker1") or by its half-length, the period, and a	
	distortion factor ("ricker2"). "ricker" is an acceptable	
	alias for "ricker1".						

	The Berlage wavelet is defined by the peak frequency fpeak, a time 
	time exponent tn describing the wavelet shape at its beginning,	
	and an exponential decay factor describing the amplitude decay	
	towards later times. The parameters tn and decay are non-negative, 
	real numbers; tn is typically a small integer number and decay a   
	multiple of the dominant signal period 1/fpeak. Additionally, an   
	initial phase angle can be given; use -90 or 90 degrees for	
	zero-amplitude at the beginning.				   

	For an AKB wavelet, fpeak is the maximum frequency; the peak	
	frequency is about 1/3 of the fpeak value.			 

	The output wavelet can be normalized or scaled with "sugain".	
	Use "suvibro" to generate a Vibroseis sweep.			

 Example:								
 A normalized, zero-phase Ricker wavelet with a peak frequency		
 of 15 Hz is generated and convolved with a spike dataset:		

	suwaveform type=ricker1 fpeak=15 | sugain pbal=1 > wavelet.su	
	suplane npl=1 | suconv sufile=wavelet.su | suxwigb		

 Gaussian and derivatives of Gaussians:				
 Use "sudgwaveform" to generate these				

 Caveat:								
	This program does not check for aliasing.
