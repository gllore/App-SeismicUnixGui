 SUSPIKE - make a small spike data set 			

 suspike [optional parameters] > out_data_file  		

 Creates a common offset su data file with up to four spikes	
 for impulse response studies					

 Optional parameters:						
	nt=64 		number of time samples			
	ntr=32		number of traces			
 	dt=0.004 	time sample rate in seconds		
 	offset=400 	offset					
	nspk=4		number of spikes			
	ix1= ntr/4	trace number (from left) for spike #1	
	it1= nt/4 	time sample to spike #1			
	ix2 = ntr/4	trace for spike #2			
	it2 = 3*nt/4 	time for spike #2			
	ix3 = 3*ntr/4;	trace for spike #3			
	it3 = nt/4;	time for spike #3			
	ix4 = 3*ntr/4;	trace for spike #4			
	it4 = 3*nt/4;	time for spike #4
