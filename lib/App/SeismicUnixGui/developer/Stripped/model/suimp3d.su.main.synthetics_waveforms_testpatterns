 Theory: Use the 3D Born integral equation (e.g., Geophysics,
 v51, n8, p1554(7)). Use 3-D delta function for alpha.

 Note: Setting a 3D offset in a single offset field beats the
       hell out of us.  We did _something_.

 Trace header fields set: ns, dt, tracl, tracr, fldr, tracf,
                          sx, sy, selev, gx, gy, gelev, offset
