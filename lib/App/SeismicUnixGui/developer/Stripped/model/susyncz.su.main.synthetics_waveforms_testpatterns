 SUSYNCZ - SYNthetic seismograms for piecewise constant V(Z) function	
	   True amplitude (primaries only) modeling for 2.5D		

  susyncz > outfile [parameters]					

 Required parameters:							
 none									

 Optional Parameters:							
 ninf=4        number of interfaces (not including upper surface)	
 dip=5*i       dips of interfaces in degrees (i=1,2,3,4)		
 zint=100*i    z-intercepts of interfaces at x=0 (i=1,2,3,4)		
 v=1500+ 500*i velocities below surface & interfaces (i=0,1,2,3,4)	
 rho=1,1,1,1,1 densities below surface & interfaces (i=0,1,2,3,4)	
 nline=1	number of (identical) lines				
 ntr=32        number of traces					
 dx=10         trace interval						
 tdelay=0      delay in recording time after source initiation		
 dt=0.004      time interval						
 nt=128        number of time samples					

 Notes:								
 The original purpose of this code was to create some nontrivial	
 data for Brian Sumner's CZ suite.					

 The program produces zero-offset data over dipping reflectors.	

 In the original fortran code, some arrays had the index		
 interval 1:ninf, as a natural way to index over the subsurface	
 reflectors.  This indexing was preserved in this C translation.	
 Consequently, some arrays in the code do not use the 0 "slot".	

 Example:								
	susyncz | sufilter | sugain tpow=1 | display_program		

 Trace header fields set: tracl, ns, dt, delrt, ntr, sx, gx
