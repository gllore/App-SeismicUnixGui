 SUDGWAVEFORM - make Gaussian derivative waveform in SU format		

  sudgwaveform >stdout  [optional parameters]				


 Optional parameters:							
 n=2    	order of derivative (n>=1)				
 fpeak=35	peak frequency						
 nfpeak=n*n	max. frequency = nfpeak * fpeak				
 nt=128	length of waveform					
 shift=0	additional time shift in s (used for plotting)		
 sign=1	use =-1 to change sign					
 verbose=0	=0 don't display diagnostic messages			
               =1 display diagnostic messages				
 Notes:								
 This code computes a waveform that is the n-th order derivative of a	
 Gaussian. The variance of the Gaussian is specified through its peak	
 frequency, i.e. the frequency at which the amplitude spectrum of the	
 Gaussian has a maximum. nfpeak is used to compute maximum frequency,	
 which in turn is used to compute the sampling interval. Increasing	
 nfpeak gives smoother plots. In order to have a (pseudo-) causal	
 pulse, the program computes a time shift equal to sqrt(n)/fpeak. An	
 additional shift can be applied with the parameter shift. A positive	
 value shifts the waveform to the right.				

 Examples:								
 2-loop Ricker: dgwaveform n=1	>ricker2.su				
 3-loop Ricker: dgwaveform n=2 >ricker3.su				
 Sonic transducer pulse: dgwaveform n=10 fpeak=300 >sonic.su		

 To display use suxgraph. For example:					
 dgwaveform n=10 fpeak=300 | suxgraph style=normal &			

 For other seismic waveforms, please use "suwaveform".
