 Notes:								
 This algorithm is based on formula (58) in Geo. Pros. 34, 686-703,	
 by N. Bleistein.							

 Traveltime and amplitude are calculated by finite difference which	
 is done only in one of every NXD receivers; in skipped receivers, 	
 interpolation is used to calculate traveltime and amplitude.		", 
 For each receiver, traveltime and amplitude are calculated in the 	
 horizontal range of (xg-nxb*dx, xg+nxb*dx). Velocity is changed by 	
 constant extropolation in two upper trianglar corners whose width is 	
 nxc*dx and height is nzc*dz.						

 Eikonal equation will fail to solve if there is a polar turned ray.	
 In this case, the program shows the related geometric information. 	
 There are three ways to remove the turned rays: smoothing velocity, 	
 reducing nxb, and increaing nxc and nzc (if the turned ray occurs  	
 in shallow areas). To prevent traveltime distortion from an over-	
 smoothed velocity, traveltime is corrected based on the slowness 	
 perturbation.								

 More than one ref (reflector) may be specified.			
 Note that reflectors are encoded as quoted strings, with an optional	
 reflector amplitude: preceding the x,z coordinates of each reflector.	
 Default amplitude is 1.0 if amplitude: part of the string is omitted.
