 SUCOMMAND - pipe traces having the same key header word to command	

     sucommand <stdin >stdout [Optional parameters]			

 Required parameters:							
 	none								

 Optional parameters: 							
 	verbose=0		wordy output				
 	key=cdp			header key word to pipe on		
 	command="suop nop"    command piped into			
	dir=0		0:  change of header key

Notes:									
 This program permits limited parallel processing capability by opening
 pipes for processes, signaled by a change in key header word value.

 Note:
	The "valxxx" subroutines are in su/lib/valpkge.c.  In particular,
      "valcmp" shares the annoying attribute of "strcmp" that
		if (valcmp(type, val, valnew) {
			...
		}
	will be performed when val and valnew are different.
