 SUTSQ -- time axis time-squared stretch of seismic traces	

 sutsq [optional parameters] <stdin >stdout 			

 Required parameters:						
	none				 			

 Optional parameters:						
       tmin= .1*nt*dt  minimum time sample of interest		
                       (only needed for forward transform)	
       dt= .004       output sample rate			
                       (only needed for inverse transform)	
       flag= 1        1=forward transform: time to time squared
                     -1=inverse transform: time squared to time

 Note: The output of the forward transform always starts with	
 time squared equal to zero.  'tmin' is used to avoid aliasing	
 the early times.
	


 Caveats:
 	Amplitudes are not well preserved.
