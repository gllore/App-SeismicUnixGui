Differences between the following packages:

whereami: temporarily establish the widget you are in
  and determine which condition you are using in a namespace 
  outside that of the main program
 
private_conditions: temporarily establish the widget in a private hash 
  within the namespace of the main program and hence accessible to all 
  local methods
  disable or enable certain widgets
  keep track of flow index

decisions:
  Judge conditions for making choices automatically
  the namespace.
  
  Superflows/tools read configuration files and write configuration files
   using internal libraries, i.e. not Config-Simple
   configuration parameters are found in arrays and not in hashes as for
   the outside libraries of Config-Simple
 
 Main: select_superflow
 
       superflow_configs:
 
                 config_superflows: reads variables using readfiles.pm
 
 		param_widgets sets the variables for tduplicated in a separate namespace too
 
 
 How to add variables to the gui for superflows
 
 add new variables in file ~/big_streams/config/Project.config
 					and file ./Project.config
 modify:  package    ~/big_streams/config/Project.pm
 				add to hash: 
 					_geomaps_is_selected			=> '',
 					
 			sub     local_change_basic_dirs
 				add:
 			    	my ($geomaps);
 			    	  	$geomaps		= $CFG[17];
 			    	  	
 			    	  		$Project->{_geomaps_is_selected} = $geomaps;
