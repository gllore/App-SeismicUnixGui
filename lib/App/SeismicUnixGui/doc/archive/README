=head3  In order to create an su module for
incorporation into L_SU 

 you will need access to the self-instructions of the
 seismic unix module, which I find in:
  /usr/local/pl/L_SU/developer/Stripped/'group of programs'
where 'group of programs' is a generic type of programs, e.g.
modeling programs are found within the folder called:
'model'

 1. modify the following:

  sudoc2pm.pl

  by adding lines, such as the following:
  
 e.g., group=8 is the group of modeling
 programs whose readme files are 
 found in ~developer/Stripped/model
 
   my $group_no = 8;  
   my $selected_program_name = 'sufctanismod';

 2. run the following:

  perl sudoc2pm.pl ( under ~L_SU)

=cut
