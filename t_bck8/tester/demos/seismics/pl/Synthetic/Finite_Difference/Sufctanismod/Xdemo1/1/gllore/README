# DEMO of sufctanismod:
# By Stig-Kyrre Foss, CWP November 2001.
#
# The program is a modelling code to create snapshot and seismograms
# in an anisotropic media.
#
# This is a demo of running sufctanismod with binary input files 
# with the elastic parameters and the inverse density. We remark 
# that every distance (e.g. receiverdepth, sx and fctxbeg) is given 
# in number of gridpoints and not actual size. The suggested files 
# are for a 2-D testrun in a TIV media (no anisotropy in test though). 
# "dummy_zero.dir" is a file containing only zeros. For additional 
# information see the comments in the code.
#
# The test creates a 100x100 gridpoint model with 2 layers (see 
# Makesmallmodel for details) and 5m grid spacing, thus the model is 
# 500x500m with a horizontal interface in the middle.   
#
# The output seismograms can be viewed by suximage directly.
# 
# How to:
# 1. Run the program Makesmalltest to create the modelspace.
# 2. Run Xsufctanismod. This will give you a resulting vertical component
#    of the horizontal seismogram from the modelling code. The result 
#    shows the strong direct wave and later (in time) the reflection 
#    from the interface.
