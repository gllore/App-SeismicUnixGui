=head2 Instructions

=head3  In order to create an su module, from this directory,

 you will need access to the self-instructions of the
 seismic unix module, which I find in:
  /usr/local/cwp_su_all_48/src/doc/Stripped

 1. modify the following:

  sudoc2pm.pl

  by adding a line, such as the following:
 	$file_in[0] 				= 'xgraph.Xtcwp.main';

 2. run the following:

  perl sudoc2pm.pl ( under ~L_SU)

=cut
