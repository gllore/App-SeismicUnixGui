 SUMEAN - get the mean values of data traces				",	

 sumean < stdin > stdout [optional parameters] 			

 Required parameters:							
   power = 2.0		mean to the power				
			(e.g. = 1.0 mean amplitude, = 2.0 mean energy)	

 Optional parameters: 							
   verbose = 0		writes mean value of section to outpar	   	
			= 1 writes mean value of each trace / section to
				outpar					
   outpar=/dev/tty   output parameter file				
   abs = 1             average absolute value 
                       = 0 preserve sign if power=1.0

 Notes:			 					
 Each sample is raised to the requested power, and the sum of all those
 values is averaged for each trace (verbose=1) and the section.	
 The values power=1.0 and power=2.0 are physical, however other powers	
 represent other mathematical L-p norms and may be of use, as well.
