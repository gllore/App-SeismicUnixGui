 Notes:								
 The signal-noise separation algorithm was developed by Dr. Bill Harlan
 in 1984. It can be used to separate events that can be focused by a	
 linear transformation (signal) from events that can't (noise). The	
 linear transform is whatever is well siuted for the application at	
 hand. Here, only the discrete Radon transform is used, so the program	
 is capable of separating events focused by that transform (linear,	
 parabolic or time-invariantly hyperbolic). Should other transform be	
 required, the changes to the program will be relatively		
 straightforward.							

 The reliability parameter is the most critical one to determine what	
 to extract as signal and what to reject as noise. It should be tested	
 for every dataset. The way to test it is to start with a small value,	
 say 0.1 or 0.01. If too much noise is present in the extracted noise,	
 it is too low. If too much signal was extracted, that is, part of the	
 signal was lost, it is too big. All other parameters have good default
 values and should perhaps not be changed in a first encounter with the
 program. The transform parameters are also critical. They should be	
 chosen such that no aliasing is present and such that the range of	
 interesting slopes is spanned by the transform but not much more. The 
 program suradon.c has more documentation on the transform paramters.
