 SUPAD - Pad zero traces						

  supad <stdin >stdout min= max= [optional parameters]			

 Required parameters:							
  min=			trace key start					
  max=			trace key end					

 Optional parameters:							
  key1=ep		panel key 					
  key2=tracf		trace key 					
  key3=trid		flag key					
  val3=2		value assigned to padded traces			
  d=1			trace key spacing				

 Notes:								
  In contrast to most SU codes, supad recognizes panels, or ensembles.	
  If the input consists of several panels, each panel will be padded	
  individually.							
  key1 and key2 are the primary and secondary sort key of the data set.
  The sort order of key1 does not matter at all.			
  The sort order of key2 must be monotonous - if key2 is descending,	
	supply a negative value for the spacing d.			
  Traces with a key2-value outside the min/max range will be lost. 	
  Traces with a key2-value that is not a multiple of the spacing from	
	the min-value (the max-value, if the spacing is negative) will	
	not be lost. Instead, they will shift the series of key2-values.
  By default the dead trace flag will be raised for the padded traces.	
  This should make it easy to remove the zero traces later on, if need be.

 Examples:								
	suplane | supad min=1 max=40 key1=offset key2=tracr | ...	
	... appends eight empty traces.					

	suplane | supad min=1 max=32 key1=offset key2=tracr d=0.5 | ...	
	... inserts a zero trace after each trace (even though the	
	header tracr is integer and cannot properly store the floats)	

	suplane | supad min=1 max=32 | ...				
	... produces an error because the panel and trace key are all 0.
