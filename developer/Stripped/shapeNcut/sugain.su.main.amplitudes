 SUGAIN - apply various types of gain				  	

 sugain <stdin >stdout [optional parameters]			   	

 Required parameters:						  	
	none (no-op)						    	

 Optional parameters:						  	
	panel=0	        =1  gain whole data set (vs. trace by trace)	
	tpow=0.0	multiply data by t^tpow			 	
	epow=0.0	multiply data by exp(epow*t)		    	
	etpow=1.0	multiply data by exp(epow*t^etpow)	    	
	gpow=1.0	take signed gpowth power of scaled data	 	
	agc=0	   flag; 1 = do automatic gain control	     		
	gagc=0	  flag; 1 = ... with gaussian taper			
	wagc=0.5	agc window in seconds (use if agc=1 or gagc=1)  
	trap=none	zero any value whose magnitude exceeds trapval  
	clip=none	clip any value whose magnitude exceeds clipval  
	pclip=none	clip any value greater than clipval  		
	nclip=none	clip any value less than  clipval 		
	qclip=1.0	clip by quantile on absolute values on trace    
	qbal=0	  flag; 1 = balance traces by qclip and scale     	
	pbal=0	  flag; 1 = bal traces by dividing by rms value   	
	mbal=0	  flag; 1 = bal traces by subtracting the mean    	
	maxbal=0	flag; 1 = balance traces by subtracting the max 
	scale=1.0	multiply data by overall scale factor	   	
	norm=0.0	divide data by overall scale factor	     	
	bias=0.0	bias data by adding an overall bias value	
	jon=0	   	flag; 1 means tpow=2, gpow=.5, qclip=.95	
	verbose=0	verbose = 1 echoes info				
	mark=0		apply gain only to traces with tr.mark=0	
			=1 apply gain only to traces with tr.mark!=0    
	vred=0	  reducing velocity of data to use with tpow		

 	tmpdir=		if non-empty, use the value as a directory path	
			prefix for storing temporary files; else if the 
			the CWP_TMPDIR environment variable is set use  
			its value for the path; else use tmpfile()	

 Operation order:							
 if (norm) scale/norm						  	

 out(t) = scale * BAL{CLIP[AGC{[t^tpow * exp(epow * t^tpow) * ( in(t)-bias )]^gpow}]}

 Notes:								
	The jon flag selects the parameter choices discussed in		
	Claerbout's Imaging the Earth, pp 233-236.			

	Extremely large/small values may be lost during agc. Windowing  
	these off and applying a scale in a preliminary pass through	
	sugain may help.						

	Sugain only applies gain to traces with tr.mark=0. Use sushw,	
	suchw, suedit, or suxedit to mark traces you do not want gained.
	See the selfdocs of sushw, suchw, suedit, and suxedit for more	
	information about setting header fields. Use "sukeyword mark
	for more information about the mark header field.		

      debias data by using mbal=1					

      option etpow only becomes active if epow is nonzero
