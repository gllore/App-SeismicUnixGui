 SUPUTGTHR - split the stdout flow to gathers on the bases of given	
 		key parameter. 						

	suputgthr <stdin   dir= [Optional parameters]			

 Required parameters:							
 dir=		Name of directory where to put the gathers		
 Optional parameters: 							
 key=ep		header key word to watch   			
 suffix=".hsu"	extension of the output files			
 verbose=0		verbose = 1 echos information			
 numlength=7		Length of numeric part of filename		

 Notes: 			    					
 The name of the file is constructed from the key parameter. Traces	
 are put into a temporary disk file, and renamed when key parameter	
 changes in the input flow to "key.suffix". The result is that the	
 directory "dir" contains separate files by "key" ensemble. 	",	

 Header field modified:  ntr  to be the number of traces in a given 	
 ensemble.

 Note:
	The "valxxx" subroutines are in su/lib/valpkge.c.  In particular,
	"valcmp" shares the annoying attribute of "strcmp" that
		if (valcmp(type, val, valnew) {
			...
		}
	will be performed when val and valnew are different.
