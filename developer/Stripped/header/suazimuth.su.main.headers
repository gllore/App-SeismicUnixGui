   az=0           azimuth convention flag                               
                   0: 0-179.999 deg, reciprocity assumed                
                   1: 0-359.999 deg, points from receiver to source     
                  -1: 0-359.999 deg, points from source to receiver     
   sector=1.0     if set, defines output in sectors of size             
                  sector=degrees_per_sector, the default mode is        
                  the full range of angles specified by az              

   offset=0       if offset=1 then set offset header field              
   offkey=offset  header field to store computed offsets in             

   cmp=0          if cmp=1, then compute midpoint coordinates and       
                  set header fields for (cmpx, cmpy)                    
   mxkey=ep       header field to store computed cmpx in                
   mykey=cdp      header field to store computed cmpy in                

 Notes:                                                                 
   All values are computed from the values in the coordinate fields     
   sx,sy (source) and gx,gy (receiver).                                 
   The output field "otrav" for the azimuth was chosen arbitrarily as 
   an example of a little-used header field, however, the user may      
   choose any field that is convenient for his or her application.      

   Setting the sector=number_of_degrees_per_sector sets key field to    
   sector number rather than an angle in degrees.                       

   For az=0, azimuths are measured from the North, however, reciprocity 
   is assumed, so azimuths go from 0 to 179.9999 degrees. If sector     
   option is set, then the range is from 0 to 180/sector.               

   For az=1, azimuths are measured from the North, with the assumption  
   that the direction vector points from the receiver to the source.    
   For az=-1, the direction vector points from the source to the        
   receiver. No reciprocity is assumed in these cases, so the angles go 
   from 0 to 359.999 degrees.                                           
   If the sector option is set, then the range is from 0 to 360/sector. 

 Caveat:                                                                
   This program honors the value of scalco in scaling the values of     
   sx,sy,gx,gy. Type "sukeyword scalco" for more information.         

   Type "sukeyword -o" to see the keywords and descriptions of all    
   header fields.                                                       

   To plot midpoints, use: su3dchart                                    


 Credits:
  based on suchw, su3dchart
      CWP: John Stockwell and  UTulsa: Chris Liner, Oct. 1998
      UTulsa: Chris Liner added offset option, Feb. 2002
         cll: fixed offset option and added cmp option, May 2003
      RISSC: Nils Maercklin added key options for offset and 
             midpoints, and added azimuth direction option, Sep. 2006

  Algorithms:
      offset = osign * sqrt( (gx-sx)*(gx-sx) + (gy-sy)*(gy-sy) )
               with osign = sgn( min((sx-gx),(sy-gy)) )

      midpoint x  value  xm = (sx + gx)/2
      midpoint y  value  ym = (sy + gy)/2
 
  Azimuth will be defined as the angle, measured in degrees,
  turned from North, of a vector pointing to the source from the midpoint, 
  or from the midpoint to the source. Azimuths go from 0-179.000 degrees
  or from 0-180.0 degrees.
   
  value(key) = scale*[90.0 - (180.0/PI)*(atan((sy - ym)/(sx - xm))) ]
      or
  value(key) = scale*[180.0 - (180.0/PI)*(atan2((ym - sy),(xm - sx)) ]
