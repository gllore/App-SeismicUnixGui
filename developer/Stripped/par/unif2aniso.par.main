 			=mono for monotonic cubic interpolation of interface
			=akima for Akima's cubic interpolation of interface
			=spline for cubic spline interpolation of interface

 tfile=		=testfilename  if set, a sample input dataset is
 			 output to "testfilename".			

 Notes:								
 The input file is an ASCII file containing x z values representing a	
 piecewise continuous velocity model with a flat surface on top.	

 The surface and each successive boundary between media is represented 
 by a list of selected x z pairs written column form. The first and	
 last x values must be the same for all boundaries. Use the entry	
 1.0  -99999  to separate the entries for successive boundaries. No	
 boundary may cross another. Note that the choice of the method of	
 interpolation may cause boundaries to cross that do not appear to	
 cross in the input data file.						

 The number of interfaces is specified by the parameter "ninf". This 
 number does not include the top surface of the model. The input data	
 format is the same as a CSHOT model file with all comments removed.	

 The algorithm works by transforming the P-wavespeed , S-wavespeed,	
 density and the Thomsen or Sayers parameters epsilon, delta, and gamma
 into elastic stiffness coefficients. Furthermore, the	user can specify
 rotations, phi, to the elasticity tensor in each layer.		

 Common ranges of Thomsen parameters are				
  epsilon:  0.0 -> 0.5							
  delta:   -0.2 -> 0.4							
  gamma:	0.0 -> 0.4							

 If only P-wave, S-wave velocities and density is given as input,	
 the model is, by definition,  isotropic.				

 If files containing Thomsen/Sayers parameters are given, the model	
 will be assumed to have VTI symmetry.		 			

 Example using test input file generating feature:			
 unif2aniso tfile=testfilename  produces a 5 interface demonstration model
 unif2aniso < testfilename 						
 ximage < c11_file n1=100 n2=100					
 ximage < c13_file n1=100 n2=100					
 ximage < c15_file n1=100 n2=100					
 ximage < c33_file n1=100 n2=100
