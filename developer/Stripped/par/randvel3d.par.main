 RANDVEL3D - Add a random velocity layer (RVL) to a gridded             
            v(x,y,z) velocity model                                    

	randvel3d <infile n1= n2= >outfile [parameters]			

 Required Parameters:							
 n1=		number of samples along 1st dimension			
 n2=		number of samples along 2nd dimension			

 Optional Parameters:							

 n3=1          number of samples along 3rd dimension			

 mode=1             add single layer populated with random vels	
                    =2 add nrvl layers of random thickness and vel     
 seed=from_clock    random number seed (integer)			

 ---->New layer geometry info						
 i1beg=1       1st dimension beginning sample 				
 i1end=n1/5    1st dimension ending sample 				
 i2beg=1       2nd dimension beginning sample 				
 i2end=n2      2nd dimension ending sample 				
 i3beg=1       3rd dimension beginning sample 				
 i3end=n3      3rd dimension ending sample 				
 ---->New layer velocity info						
 vlsd=v/3     range (std dev) of random velocity in layer, 		
               where v=v(0,0,i1) and i1=(i1beg+i1end)/2 	 	
 add=1         add random vel to original vel (v_orig) at that point 	
               =0 replace vel at that point with (v_orig+v_rand) 	
 how=0         random vels can be higher or lower than v_orig		
               =1 random vels are always lower than v_orig		
               =2 random vels are always higher than v_orig		
 cvel=2000     layer filled with constant velocity cvel 		
               (overides vlsd,add,how params)			
 ---->Smoothing parameters (0 = no smoothing)				
 r1=0.0	1st dimension operator length in samples		
 r2=0.0	2nd dimension operator length in samples		
 r3=0.0	3rd dimension operator length in samples		
 slowness=0	=1 smoothing on slowness; =0 smoothing on velocity	

 nrvl=n1/10    number of const velocity layers to add     		
 pdv=10.       percentage velocity deviation (max) from input model	

 Notes:								
 1. Smoothing radii usually fall in the range of [0,20].		
 2. Smoothing radii can be used to set aspect ratio of random velocity 
    anomalies in the new layer.  For example (r1=5,r2=0,r3=0) will     
    result in vertical vel streaks that mimick vertical fracturing.    
 3. Smoothing on slowness works better to preserve traveltimes relative
    to the unsmoothed case.						
 4. Default case is a random velocity (+/-30%) near surface layer whose
    thickness is 20% of the total 2D model thickness.			
 5. Each layer vel is a random perturbation on input model at that level.
 6. The depth dimension is assumed to be along axis 1.			

 Example:								
 1. 2D RVL with no smoothing						
   makevel nz=250 nx=200 | randvel3d n1=250 n2=200 | ximage n1=250      
 2. 3D RVL with no smoothing						
   makevel nz=250 nx=200 ny=220 |					
   randvel3d n1=250 n2=200 n3=220 | 					
   xmovie n1=250 n2=200
