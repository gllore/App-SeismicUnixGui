 			=mono for monotonic cubic interpolation of interface
			=akima for Akima's cubic interpolation of interface
			=spline for cubic spline interpolation of interface

 tfile=		=testfilename  if set, a sample input dataset is
 			 output to "testfilename".			

 Notes:								
 The input file is an ASCII file containing x z values representing a	
 piecewise continuous velocity model with a flat surface on top.	

 The surface and each successive boundary between media is represented 
 by a list of selected x z pairs written column form. The first and	
 last x values must be the same for all boundaries. Use the entry	
 1.0  -99999  to separate the entries for successive boundaries. No	
 boundary may cross another. Note that the choice of the method of	
 interpolation may cause boundaries to cross that do not appear to	
 cross in the input data file.						

 The number of interfaces is specified by the parameter "ninf". This 
 number does not include the top surface of the model. The input data	
 format is the same as a CSHOT model file with all comments removed.	

 The algorithm works by transforming the P-wavespeed, Thomsen parameters 
 epsilon and delta, and the tilt of the symmetry axis into density-normalized", 
 stiffness coefficients. 						

 At this stage, the tilt-field file can be prepared using the 		
 Matlab M-file nu_mod.m based on 2D interpolation between interfaces.  ", 
 The binary file contains nu values at each grid point.		
 The interfaces are obtained by interpolation on the picked ones 	
 stored in the infile, and the symmetry axis at each point of interface
 is assumed to be parallel to the normal direction.			

 Common ranges of Thomsen parameters are				
  epsilon:  0.0 -> 0.5							
  delta:   -0.2 -> 0.4							


 If the tilt-field file is not given, the model will be assumed to 	
 have VTI symmetry. 				 			

 Example using test input file generating feature:			
 unif2aniso tfile=testfilename  produces a 5 interface demonstration model
 unif2aniso < testfilename 						
 ximage < c11_file n1=100 n2=100					
 ximage < c13_file n1=100 n2=100					
 ximage < c15_file n1=100 n2=100					
 ximage < c33_file n1=100 n2=100					
 ximage < c35_file n1=100 n2=100					
 ximage < c55_file n1=100 n2=100					
 ximage < rho_file n1=100 n2=100
