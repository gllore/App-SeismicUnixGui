 VELCONV - VELocity CONVersion					

 velconv <infile >outfile intype= outtype= [optional parameters]

 Required Parameters:						
 intype=                input data type (see valid types below)
 outtype=               output data type (see valid types below)

 Valid types for input and output data are:			
 vintt          interval velocity as a function of time	
 vrmst          RMS velocity as a function of time		
 vintz          velocity as a function of depth		
 zt             depth as a function of time			
 tz             time as a function of depth			

 Optional Parameters:						
 nt=all                 number of time samples			
 dt=1.0                 time sampling interval			
 ft=0.0                 first time				
 nz=all                 number of depth samples		
 dz=1.0                 depth sampling interval		
 fz=0.0                 first depth				
 nx=all                 number of traces			

 Example:  "intype=vintz outtype=vrmst" converts an interval velocity
           function of depth to an RMS velocity function of time.

 Notes:  nt, dt, and ft are used only for input and output functions
         of time; you need specify these only for vintt, vrmst, orzt.
         Likewise, nz, dz, and fz are used only for input and output
         functions of depth.					

 The input and output data formats are C-style binary floats.
