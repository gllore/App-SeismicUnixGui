 SEGYCLEAN - zero out unassigned portion of header		

 segyclean <stdin >stdout 					

 Since "foreign" SEG-Y tapes may use the unassigned portion	
 of the trace headers and since SU now uses it too, this	
 program zeros out the fields meaningful to SU.		

  Example:							
  	segyread trmax=200 | segyclean | suximage
