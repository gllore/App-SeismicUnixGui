 n1=                    number of samples in each trace		

 Optional Parameters:

 Notes:                                                                
  This program is used to compress a 2D section using 1D method.	
  It is not a true 2D compression algorithm, since the later diretion	
  is not compressed at all. It can be used in situations where random	
  accessing of each trace is desirable, or when there are very few	
  traces and normal 2D compression algorithm will not compress.	

  The parameter error is used control the allowable compression error,	
  and thus the compression ratio. The larger the error, the more 	
  the more compression you can get. The amount of error depends on 	
  the type of data and the application of the compression. From my 	
  experience, error=0.01 is a safe choice even when the compressed data 	
  are used for further processing. For some other applications, it 	
  may be set higher to achieve larger compression.			", 

 Caveats:								
  For the current implementation, the compressed data themselves are	
  NOT portable, i.e., the data compressed on one platform might not be	
  recognizable on another.
