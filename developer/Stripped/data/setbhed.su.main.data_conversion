 SETBHED - SET the fields in a SEGY Binary tape HEaDer file, as would be
 	    produced by segyread and segyhdrs				

 setbhed par= [optional parameters]					

 Required parameter:							
 	none								
 Optional parameters:							
	bfile=binary		output binary tape header file		
	par=			=parfile				
 Set field by field, if desired:					
 	jobid=			job id field				
 	lino=			line number (only one line per reel)	
 	reno=			reel number				
 	format=			data format				
 ... etc....								
 To set any binary header field, use sukeyword to find out		
 the appropriate keyword, then use the getpar form:			
 	keyword=value	to set keyword to value				
 Notes:								
 As with all other programs in the CWP/SU package that use getpars, 	
 (GET PARameters from the command line) a file filled with such	
 statments may be included via option par=parfile. In particular, a	
 parfile created by   "bhedtopar"  may be used as input for the program
 "setbhed".								

 The binary header file that results from running segyread may have the
 wrong byte order. You will need to use "swapbhed" to change the byte,"
 order before applying this program. 					

 Example:								
   segyread tape=yourdata.segy bfile=yourdata.b > yourdata.su		
 If  									
   bhedtopar < yourdata.b | more 					
 shows impossible values, then apply 					
   swapbhed < yourdata.b > swapped.b					
 then apply 								
   bhedtopar < swapped.b | more 					
   bhedtopar < swapped.b outpar=parfile				
 hand edit parfile, and then apply 					
  setbhed par=parfile bfile=swapped.b > new.b				
 then apply 								
   segywrite tape=fixeddata.segy bfile=new.b < yourdata.su		

 Caveat: This program breaks if a "short" isn't 2 bytes since	
         the SEG-Y standard demands a 2 byte integer for ns.
