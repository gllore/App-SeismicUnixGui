 SUSHIFT - shifted/windowed traces in time				

 sushift <stdin >stdout [tmin= ] [tmax= ]				

 tmin=			min time to pass				
 tmax=			max time to pass				
 dt=                    sample rate in microseconds 			
 fill=0.0               value to place in padded samples 		

 (defaults for tmin and tmax are calculated from the first trace.	
 verbose=		1 echos parameters to stdout			

 Background :								
 tmin and tmax must be given in seconds				

 In the high resolution single channel seismic profiling the sample 	
 interval is short, the shot rate and the number of samples are high.	
 To reduce the file size the delrt time is changed during a profiling	
 trip. To process and display a seismic section a constant delrt is	
 needed. This program does this job.					

 The SEG-Y header variable delrt (delay in ms) is a short integer.	
 That's why in the example shown below delrt is rounded to 123 !	

   ... | sushift tmin=0.1234 tmax=0.2234 | ...				

 The dt= and fill= options are intended for manipulating velocity	
 volumes in trace format.  In particular models which were hung	
 from the water bottom when created & which then need to have the	
 water layer added.
