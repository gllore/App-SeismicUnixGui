 Notes:								
 For hdrs=1, statics calculation is not performed, statics correction  
 is applied to the data by reading statics (in ms) from the header.	

 For hdrs=0, field statics are calculated, and				
 	input field sut is assumed measured in ms.			
 	output field sstat = 10^scalel*(sdel - selev + sdepth)/swevel	
 	output field gstat = sstat - sut/1000.				
 	output field tstat = sstat + gstat + 10^scalel*(selev - gelev)/wevel

 For hdrs=2, statics are surface consistently obtained from the 	
 statics files. The geometry should be regular.			
 The source- and receiver-statics files should be unformated C binary 	
 floats and contain the statics (in ms) as a function of surface location.

 For hdrs=3, residual refraction statics and average refraction statics
 are computed.  For hdrs=4, residual refraction statics are applied,   
 and for hdrs=5, average refraction statics are applied (Cox, 1999).   
 These three options are coupled in many data processing sequences:    
 before stack residual and average refraction statics are computed but 
 only residual refractions statics are applied, and after stack average
 refraction statics are applied.  Refraction statics are often split   
 like this to avoid biasing stacking velocities.  The files blvl_file  
 and refr_file are the base of the velocity model defined in vfile and 
 the final reference datum, as described by Cox (1999), respectively.  
 Residual refraction statics are stored in the header field gstat, and 
 the average statics are stored in the header field tstat.  V_r is the 
 replacement velocity as described by Cox (1999).  The velocity file,  
 vfile, is designed to work with a horizontal upper surface defined in 
 refr_file.  If the survey has irregular topography, the horizontal    
 upper surface should be above the highest topographic point on the    
 line, and the velocity between this horizontal surface and topography 
 should be some very large value, such as 999999999, so that the       
 traveltimes through that region are inconsequential.
