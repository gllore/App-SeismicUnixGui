 SUZTOT - resample from depth to time					

 suztot <stdin >stdout [optional parms]				

 Optional Parameters:							
 nt=1+(nz-1)*2.0*dz/(vmax*dt)    number of time samples in output	
 dt=2*dz/vmin		time sampling interval (defaults avoids aliasing)
 ft=2*fz/v(fz)		first time sample				
 z=0.0,...		depths corresponding to interval velocities in v
 v=1500.0,...		interval velocities corresponding to depths in v
 vfile=		binary (non-ascii) file containing velocities v(z)
 verbose=0		>0 to print depth sampling information		

 Notes:								
 Default value of nt set to avoid aliasing				
 The z and v arrays specify an interval velocity function of depth.	

 Note that z and v are given  as arrays of floats separated by commas,  
 for example:								
 z=0.0,100,200,... v=1500.0,1720.0,1833.5,... with the number of z values
 equaling the number of v values. The velocities are linearly interpolated
 to produce a piecewise linear v(z) profile. This fact must be taken into
 account when attempting to use this program as the inverse of suttoz.	

 Linear interpolation and constant extrapolation is used to determine	
 interval velocities at times not specified.  Values specified in z	
 must increase monotonically.						

 Alternatively, interval velocities may be stored in a binary file	
 containing one velocity for every time sample.  If vfile is specified,
 then the z and v arrays are ignored.
