 SUGOUPILLAUD - calculate 1D impulse response of	 		
     non-absorbing Goupillaud medium					

 sugoupillaud < stdin > stdout [optional parameters]			

 Required parameters:							
	none								

 Optional parameters:							
l=1source layer number; 1 <= l <= tr.ns				
			Source is located at the top of layer l.	
	k=1		receiver layer number; 1 <= k			
Receiver is located at the top of layer k.				
tmax  number of output time-samples; default:				
tmax=NINT((2*tr.ns-(l-1)-(k-1))/2)  if k < tr.ns			
			tmax=k				if k >=tr.ns	
pV=1  flag for vector field seismogram					
	(displacement, velocity, acceleration);				
=-1 for pressure seismogram.						
verbose=0  silent operation, =1 list warnings				

 Input: Reflection coefficient series:					

	 impedance[i]-impedance[i+1]					
 r[i] = ----------------------------- 					
	 impedance[i]+impedance[i+1]					

	r[0]= surface refl. coef. (as seen from above)			
r[n]= refl. coef. of the deepest interface				

 Input file is to be in SU format, i.e., binary floats with a SU header.

 Remarks:								
 1. For vector fields, a buried source produces a spike of amplitude 1	
 propagating downwards and a spike of amplitude -1 propagating upwards.
 A buried pressure source produces spikes of amplitude 1 both in the up
 and downward directions.						

 A surface source induces only a downgoing spike of amplitude 1 at the	
 top of the first layer (both for vector and pressure fields).		
 2. The sampling interval dt in the header of the input reflectivity file
 is interpreted as a two-way traveltime thicknes of the layers. The sampling
 interval of the output seismogram is the same as that of the input file.

 ANOTATION used in the code comments [arises from the use of z-transforms]:
		Z-sampled: sampling interval equal to the TWO-way 
			traveltime of the layers; 
		z-sampled: sampling interval equal to the ONE-way
			traveltime of the layers;
