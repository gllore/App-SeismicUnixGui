 SUADDEVENT - add a linear or hyperbolic moveout event to seismic data 

 suaddevent <stdin >stdout [optional parameters]		       

 Required parameters:						  
       none								

 Optional parameters:						  
     type=nmo    =lmo for linear event 				
     t0=1.0      zero-offset intercept time IN SECONDS			
     vel=3000.   moveout velocity in m/s				
     amp=1.      amplitude						
     dt=	 must provide if 0 in headers (seconds)		

 Typical usage: 
     sunull nt=500 dt=0.004 ntr=100 | sushw key=offset a=-1000 b=20 \\ 
     | suaddevent v=1000 t0=0.05 type=lmo | suaddevent v=1800 t0=0.8 \
     | sufilter f=8,12,75,90 | suxwigb clip=1 &

 Note:  code is inefficient in that to add a single "spike", with sinc
	interpolation, an entire trace is generated and added to 
	the input trace.  In fact, only a few points needed be created
	and added, but the current coding avoids the bookkeeping re
	which are the relevant points!
