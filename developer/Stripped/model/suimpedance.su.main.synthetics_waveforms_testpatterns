 SUIMPEDANCE - Convert reflection coefficients to impedances.  

 suimpedance <stdin >stdout [optional parameters]		

 Optional Parameters:					  	
 v0=1500.	Velocity at first sample (m/sec)		
 rho0=1.0e6	Density at first sample  (g/m^3)		

 Notes:							
 Implements recursion [1-R(k)]Z(k) = [1+R(k)]Z(k-1).		
 The input traces are assumed to be reflectivities, and thus are
 expected to have amplitude values between -1.0 and 1.0.
