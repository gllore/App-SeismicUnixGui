 SUFDMOD2_PML - Finite-Difference MODeling (2nd order) for acoustic wave
    equation with PML absorbing boundary conditions.			
 Caveat: experimental PML absorbing boundary condition version,	
may be buggy!								

 sufdmod2_pml <vfile >wfile nx= nz= tmax= xs= zs= [optional parameters]

 Required Parameters:							
 <vfile		file containing velocity[nx][nz]		
 >wfile		file containing waves[nx][nz] for time steps	
 nx=			number of x samples (2nd dimension)		
 nz=			number of z samples (1st dimension)		
 xs=			x coordinates of source				
 zs=			z coordinates of source				
 tmax=			maximum time					

 Optional Parameters:							
 nt=1+tmax/dt		number of time samples (dt determined for stability)
 mt=1			number of time steps (dt) per output time step	

 dx=1.0		x sampling interval				
 fx=0.0		first x sample					
 dz=1.0		z sampling interval				
 fz=0.0		first z sample					

 fmax = vmin/(10.0*h)	maximum frequency in source wavelet		
 fpeak=0.5*fmax	peak frequency in ricker wavelet		

 dfile=		input file containing density[nx][nz]		
 vsx=			x coordinate of vertical line of seismograms	
 hsz=			z coordinate of horizontal line of seismograms	
 vsfile=		output file for vertical line of seismograms[nz][nt]
 hsfile=		output file for horizontal line of seismograms[nx][nt]
 ssfile=		output file for source point seismograms[nt]	
 verbose=0		=1 for diagnostic messages, =2 for more		

 abs=1,1,1,1		Absorbing boundary conditions on top,left,bottom,right
 			sides of the model. 				
 		=0,1,1,1 for free surface condition on the top		

 ...PML parameters....                                                 
 pml_max=1000.0        PML absorption parameter                        
 pml_thick=0           half-thickness of pml layer (0 = do not use PML)

 Notes:								
 This program uses the traditional explicit second order differencing	
 method. 								

 Two different absorbing boundary condition schemes are available. The 
 first is a traditional absorbing boundary condition scheme created by 
 Hale, 1990. The second is based on the perfectly matched layer (PML)	
 method of Berenger, 1995.
