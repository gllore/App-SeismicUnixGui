 ls=1	                flag for line source				
 jpfile=stderr		job print file name 				
 mtr=100  		print verbal information at every mtr traces	

 Notes:								
 This program takes a migrated seismic section and a set of travel time
 tables generated using rayt2d for a specific background velocity model
 and generates synthetic seismic data in the form of common shot gathers.
 (Common offset gathers may be generated by using nxo=1.) (Demigration.)

 This program is a tool which may be used for the migration residual	
 statics estimation technique of Tjan, Audebert, and Larner 1994.	

1. The traveltime tables are generated by program rayt2d (or other ones)
   on relatively coarse grids, with dimension ns*nxt*nzt. In the	
   modeling process, traveltimes are interpolated into shot/geophone 	
   positions and migration section grids. 				
2. The input migration section must be an array of binary floats (no SU
   headers).								", 
3. The synthesized traces are output in common-shot gathers in SU format.
4. The memory requirement for this program is about			
    	(ns*nxt*nzt+nx*nz+4*nr*nzt+3*nxt*nzt)*4 bytes 			
    where nr = 1+min(nxt*dxt,0.5*offmax+aperx)/dxo.
