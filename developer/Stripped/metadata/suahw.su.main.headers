 SUAHW - Assign Header Word using another header word			

  suahw <stdin >stdout [optional parameters]				

 Required parameters:							
  key1=ep		output key 					
  key2=fldr		input key 					
  a=			array of key1 output values			
  b=			array of key2 input values			
  mode=extrapolate	how to assign a key1-value, when the key2-value	
			is not found in b:				
			=interpolate	interpolate			
			=extrapolate	interpolate and extrapolate	
			=zero		zero key1-values		
			=preserve	preserve key1-values		
			=transfer	transfer key2-values to key1	

 Optional parameters:							
  key3=tracf		input key 					
  c=			array of key3 input values			

 The key1-value is assigned based on the key2-value and the arrays a,b.
 If the header value of key2= equals the n'th element in b=, then the	
 header value key1= is set to the n'th element in a=.			
 The arrays a= and b= must have the same size, and the elements of b=	
 must be in ascending order.						

 The mode-switch decides what to do when a trace header has a key2-value
 that is not an element of the b-array:				
    zero - the key1-value will be set to zero				
    preserve - the key1-value will not be modified			
    transfer - the key2-value will be assigned to key1			
    interpolate - if the key2-value is greater than the n'th element	
	and less than the (n+1)'th element of b=, then the key1-value	
	will be	interpolated accordingly from the n'th and (n+1)'th	
	element of a=. Otherwise, key1 will not be changed.		
    extrapolate - same as interpolate, plus, if the key2-value is	
	smaller/greater than the first/last element of b=, then the	
	key1-value will be set to the first/last element of a=		

 The array c= can be used to prevent the modification of trace headers	
 with certain key3-values. The number of elements in c= is independent	
 of the other arrays.							
 The key1-value will not be modified, if the mode-switch is set to	
    zero, preserve, transfer - and the key3-value is an element of c=	
    interpolate, extrapolate - and the key3-value is outside of c=	
				(smaller than the first or greater than	
				the last element of c=)			

 Examples:								
  Assign shot numbers 1-3 to field file ID 1009,1011,1015 and 0 to the	
  remaining FFID (fldr):						
    suahw <data a=1,2,3 b=1009,1011,1015 mode=zero			

  Use channel numbers (tracf) to assign stations numbers (tracr) for a	
  split spread with a gap:						
    suahw <data key1=tracr a=151,128,124,101 key2=tracf b=1,24,25,48	

  Assign shot-statics:							
    suahw <data key1=sstat key2=ep a=-32,13,-4 b=1,2,3			

  Set trid to 0 for channel 1-24, but only for the record 1016:	
    suahw <data key1=trid key2=tracf key3=fldr a=0,0 b=1,24 c=1016
