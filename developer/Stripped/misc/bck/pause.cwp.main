 PAUSE - prompt and wait for user signal to continue

 Usage:   pause [optional arguments]

 Note:
 Default prompt is "press return key to continue" which is *evoked 
 by calling pause with no arguments.  The word,
 "continue", is replaced by any optional arguments handed to pause.
 Thus, the command "pause do plot" will evoke the prompt,
 "press return key to do plot".
