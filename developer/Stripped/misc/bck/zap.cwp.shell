 ZAP - kill processes by name

 Typical usages:
	zap ximage
	zap 'xmovie|xgraph'

 Zap accepts full pattern matching for the process names

 Caveat: zap assumes that the FIRST field produced by the
	Unix "ps" command is the pid (process identifier) number.
	If not, change the number in the awk print statement to
	the appropriate field.
