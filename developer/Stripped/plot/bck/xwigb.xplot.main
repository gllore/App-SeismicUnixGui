 XWIGB - X WIGgle-trace plot of f(x1,x2) via Bitmap			

 xwigb n1= [optional parameters] <binaryfile   	   

 X Functionality:							
 Button 1	Zoom with rubberband box				
 Button 2	Show mouse (x1,x2) coordinates while pressed		
 q or Q key	Quit							
 s key		Save current mouse (x1,x2) location to file		
 p or P key	Plot current window with pswigb (only from disk files)	
 a or page up keys		enhance clipping by 10%			
 c or page down keys		reduce clipping by 10%			
 up,down,left,right keys	move zoom window by half width/height	
 i or +(keypad) 		zoom in by factor 2 			
 o or -(keypad) 		zoom out by factor 2 			
    l 				lock the zoom while moving the coursor	
    u 				unlock the zoom 			
 1,2,...,9	Zoom/Move factor of the window size			

 Notes:								
	Reaching the window limits while moving within changes the zoom	
	factor in this direction. The use of zoom locking(l) disables it

 grid1=none		 grid lines on axis 1 - none, dot, dash, or solid
 x2beg=x2min		 value at which axis 2 begins			
 x2end=x2max		 value at which axis 2 ends			
 d2num=0.0		 numbered tic interval on axis 2 (0.0 for automatic)
 f2num=x2min		 first numbered tic on axis 2 (used if d2num not 0.0)
 n2tic=1		 number of tics per numbered tic on axis 2	
 grid2=none		 grid lines on axis 2 - none, dot, dash, or solid
 label2=		 label on axis 2				
 labelfont=Erg14	 font name for axes labels			
 title=		 title of plot					
 titlefont=Rom22	 font name for title				
 windowtitle=xwigb	 title on window				
 labelcolor=blue	 color for axes labels				
 titlecolor=red	 color for title				
 gridcolor=blue	 color for grid lines				
 style=seismic		 normal (axis 1 horizontal, axis 2 vertical) or 
			 seismic (axis 1 vertical, axis 2 horizontal)	
 endian=		 =0 little endian =1 big endian			
 interp=0		 no interpolation in display			
			 =1 use 8 point sinc interpolation		
 wigclip=0		 If 0, the plot box is expanded to accommodate	
			 the larger wiggles created by xcur>1.	If this 
			 flag is non-zero, the extra-large wiggles are	
			 are clipped at the boundary of the plot box.	
 plotfile=plotfile.ps   filename for interactive ploting (P)  		
 curve=curve1,curve2,...  file(s) containing points to draw curve(s)   
 npair=n1,n2,n2,...            number(s) of pairs in each file         
 curvecolor=color1,color2,...  color(s) for curve(s)                   

 Notes:								
 Xwigb will try to detect the endian value of the X-display and will	
 set it to the right value. If it gets obviously wrong information the 
 endian value will be set to the endian value of the machine that is	
 given at compile time as the value of CWPENDIAN defined in cwp.h	
 and set via the compile time flag ENDIANFLAG in Makefile.config.	

 The only time that you might want to change the value of the endian	
 variable is if you are viewing traces on a machine with a different	
 byte order than the machine you are creating the traces on AND if for 
 some reason the automaic detection of the display byte order fails.	
 Set endian to that of the machine you are viewing the traces on.	

 The interp flag is useful for making better quality wiggle trace for	
 making plots from screen dumps. However, this flag assumes that the	
 data are purely oscillatory. This option may not be appropriate for all
 data sets.								

 The curve file is an ascii file with the points specified as x1 x2    
 pairs, separated by a space, one pair to a line.  A "vector" of curve
 files and curve colors may be specified as curvefile=file1,file2,etc. 
 and curvecolor=color1,color2,etc, and the number of pairs of values   
 in each file as npair=npair1,npair2,... .
