 Notes:									

 This algorithm is based on formula (50) in Geophysics Vol. 51, 	
 1552-1558, by Cohen, J., Hagin, F., and Bleistein, N.			

 Traveltime and amplitude are calculated by ray tracing.		
 Interpolation is used to calculate traveltime and amplitude.		", 
 For each midpoint, traveltime and amplitude are calculated in the 	
 horizontal range of (xm-nxb*dx, xm+nxb*dx). Velocity is changed by 	
 linear interpolation in two upper trianglar corners whose width is 	
 nxc*dx and height is nzc*dz.						",	

 Eikonal equation will fail to solve if there is a polar turned ray.	
 In this case, the program shows the related geometric information. 	
 
 Offsets are signed - may be positive or negative. 			",
