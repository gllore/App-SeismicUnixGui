 SUMIGFD - 45-90 degree Finite difference depth migration for		
           zero-offset data.						

   sumigfd <infile >outfile vfile= [optional parameters]		

 Required Parameters:							
 nz=		number of depth sapmles					
 dz=		depth sampling interval					
 vfile=	name of file containing velocities			
 		(see Notes below concerning format of this file)	

 Optional Parameters:							
 dt=from header(dt) or .004    time sampling interval			
 dx=from header(d2) or 1.0	midpoint sampling interval		
 dip=45,65,79,80,87,89,90  	Maximum angle of dip reflector		

 tmpdir=	if non-empty, use the value as a directory path		
		prefix for storing temporary files; else if the		
		the CWP_TMPDIR environment variable is set use		
		its value for the path; else use tmpfile()		
 
 Notes:								", 
 The computation cost by dip angle is 45=65=79<80<87<89<90		
 
 The input velocity file \'vfile\' consists of C-style binary floats.	", 
 The structure of this file is vfile[iz][ix]. Note that this means that
 the x-direction is the fastest direction instead of z-direction! Such a
 structure is more convenient for the downward continuation type	
 migration algorithm than using z as fastest dimension as in other SU	
 programs. (In C  v[iz][ix] denotes a v(x,z) array, whereas v[ix][iz]  
 denotes a v(z,x) array, the opposite of what Matlab and Fortran	
 programmers may expect.)						", 
 
 Because most of the tools in the SU package (such as  unif2, unisam2,	
 and makevel) produce output with the structure vfile[ix][iz], you will
 need to transpose the velocity files created by these programs. You may
 use the SU program \'transp\' in SU to transpose such files into the	
 required vfile[iz][ix] structure.
